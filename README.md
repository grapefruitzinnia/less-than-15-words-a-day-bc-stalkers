one of our servers is being moved tomorrow, so we are all writing docs tomorrow

making a list of cs labs in nyc/maryland my brother can apply for a post-doc

the same exact person at illumina who use to help me with genomestudio at penn (bc paul wang did not know what he was doing), is the same person who is helping us now, must be a good job bc they've had for so many years.

interesting nyu cs now requires only 2 letters as well

i got hibiscus + rose tea, so good üòç

i got [this](https://www.farmrio.com/products/bright-blue-mushroom-sketch-knit-sweater) sweater and i cant wear to wear it lol :joy: :mushroom: i use to know the mushroom life cycles back in undergrad, i can memorize/remember them again if i have to, my dad said a long time ago that his theory of memory is that it's like a spaghetti noodle that's in a bowl with other noodles and once you can grab on to one end, somehow, you can remember mostly the entire thing, i dunno how close that is to reality, i dont really read stuff in neuroscience
