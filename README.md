<!--
reward for doing #1-#8: an LV bag which i will buy for myself 😅

one of our servers is being moved tomorrow, so we are all writing docs tomorrow

making a list of cs labs in nyc/maryland my brother can apply for a post-doc

the same exact person at illumina who use to help me with genomestudio at penn (bc paul wang did not know what he was doing), is the same person who is helping us now, must be a good job bc they've had for so many years.

interesting nyu cs now requires only 2 letters as well

i got hibiscus + rose tea, so good 😍

i got [this](https://www.farmrio.com/products/bright-blue-mushroom-sketch-knit-sweater) sweater and i cant wear to wear it lol :joy: :mushroom: i use to know the mushroom life cycles back in undergrad, i can memorize/remember them again if i have to, my dad said a long time ago that his theory of memory is that it's like a spaghetti noodle that's in a bowl with other noodles and once you can grab on to one end, somehow, you can remember mostly the entire thing, i dunno how close that is to reality, i dont really read stuff in neuroscience

cold morning yet its almost 80 degrees on saturday

https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1716490527997153595 im going to shop on amazon after work for expensive olive oil, cant wait for it to be 5 pm

little bit of a busy day today

im presenting during this week's weekly bioinformatics meeting -- have to make slides

tazo iced passion (hibiscus, orange peel, rose hips) & republic of tea: raspberry rose hibiscus are both so good, totes recommend

busyyy dayy

i prolly gained some weight in the past several months, its okay, i have a competitive salary and im under some stress and then i have a personal trainer i see for an hour and he's helping me with running/sprinting before work and i have lawyers -- it happens but im still a small/medium so what ... atleast i live in peace, im a medium in hervé léger, i could care less what anyone thinks of me, i literally bought sweaters that are a size small from anthropologie the other day, sweatshirts in medium at lululemon -- all with my own money that i earned with my own hard work, please stfu idc what anyone thinks

im going to be afk-ish during my PTO

sudip is saying in the gc this morning that trump is going to win 2024, mannnnn ‼️ those were some really dark times i dont want to go through that whole thing again ughhh

yay my presentation went well -- pseudo-live-demo lol

it'll just be a week and a half of pilates, restaurants and shopping lol, ill be in the city at least a couple of times, ill work on my apps -- prolly finish them hopefully

hmm it gets warmer today in the afternoon

working on apps & watching 30 Rock at the gym bc i never finished it lol

what's this apple event later today i wonder ... wow M3 I will get next year ... space black wow finally

my former bioinfo prof who is a comp bio group leader at BMS wants me to apply to the BMS grad internship program -- so i'll have to do that one summer in the future, but it's remote, no need to be in Princeton, NJ and then nomial.ai can work with BMS somehow, his wife got her phd at cornell so he's always happy to write letters, he has to do a guest lecture somehow, maybe ill start a grad club for bioinformatics and have guest speakers once in awhile, people in ny/nj, theres someone in his lab that wrote a well-known-ish bioinfo R package, i can have my current co-workers do a guest lecture too

Q. what motivates me to apply to phd programs
A. many things but also a space M3 black macbook pro bahahahaa lol

- [ ] nov 1 - read every article here https://www.growbyginkgo.com/ 
- [ ] finish apps this week (mostly done anyway)

<!-- reading papers & working on apps today

apps and sushi, i want to finish these two apps ~today~ ~tomorrow~ soon (i just have to think about something) (I'm almost done) so i can work on other schools later/tomorrow

I tried kibbeh the other day, I dunno if I can ever make it looks tough to get the shape right. ohh [here](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/baked-kibbeh/) she baked it, maybe i'll make this for thanksgiving

# [And I'll wait for you, as if I'm waiting for the storm to stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jogmnbvy0U)

# [You're a thousand times mine and I am thousand times yours, as if the earth’s reserved for you and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13982XZKxE8)

i got a new spin bike, its the competitor to the peloton and i think its better, setting that up today, got some new books to read including a new deep learning book. [this will move with me ... i think??](https://www.nordictrack.com/exercise-bikes/s22i-studio-bike) i just want to listen to my audiobooks/podcasts in the morning, im prolly not going to go along with their classes i dunno, looks fun like its pretty immersive, something fun to do before work every day. this bike is great, im so happy with it

i will submit my apps in time, it's a lot of work to bring down the word count but i'll finish it in time -- i have a sticky note to remind me all of the app deadlines next to my pillow and thats my level of dedication lol, i'll finish it, PTO was not the best time to do it

<!-- once i ~get~ earn an acceptance, i will quit my job and live off my savings/study until the semester starts, and i cant wait to do that -->

back from the city, very sleepy

rose face mask and then sleep!

workout on new bike then catch up on work emails before work, then theres an afternoon meeting on taking over a huge sequencing project from someone going on vacation, i wonder who they will give it to bc everyone else is already so busy; its great i dont have to commute to the gym in the morning bc of my new bike

i helped my coworker by fixing a python/pandas bug, one of the scripts i migrated was retired while i was on vacation ohhhh well, one of my SOPs (standard operating protocol not statement of purpose) was accepted and another was rejected bc i need to be more specific to where the data is located

sooo tired 😴 

i have books i have to read but i want more lol, i saw some new ones

im trying this hibiscus tea hot rather than cold, its okay, a little different, i prefer cold though. i got [these](https://www.manoloblahnik.com/us/scolto-25229.html) i have added them to my collection, cant wait for spring/summer

the spin class on my bike this morning was biking through an island, i maybe want to go to these places one day haha

they should have one for nyc: "Your bike has come to a full stop because you were hit with a passenger door and that's it"

~we all have to watch 12 1-hr lectures with quizzes on biomedical techniques and stuff before winter break starts again, that's 12 hrs of lectures~

i knew it was going to happen soon and it actually happened, i get a severance package :) just have to find something else, im glad i have a lot of savings, Alhamdulillah

i have a lot of deep learning books that i have to go through anyway, dont worry about me, im fine, its just ughhh, we are in a recession and that's just ughhh too

i applied to some places today! its going to be okay afterall, let's see what happens

there were other layoffs going on in other teams thoughout the summer including SEs, it got us eventually, oh well

this severance contract/form/NDA says i cant talk about the severance package hmmmm

i knew it was going to happen but i was hoping it would be next year instead ughhhhh i think i also just want a break too but im just applying for now

i want to work at the ny genome center but they're not really hiring ughh and the commute to the city will be tough, i think its hybrid, id take an uber on the days id have to be in the city, i think that's like $70 each way

went to PT for an hour, had panera for lunch, watching 30 rock, thinking of some blog posts ill make this week about stuff i learned at work, going to try and finish one app by tomorrow hopefully

i dont want to talk about it too much bc it relates to what i want to do with nomial.ai, but i didnt work for a bioinformatics company, i worked for a biotech/sample storage company that had a bioinformatics team and our clients have their own bioinformatics team that did the analysis so its not a great business to have our bioinformatics team do the analysis for our clients if they can do it themselves. i was laid-off not because of performance, that was made clear to me, its still surprising bc our team was so small anyway, it is what it is. im okay, moving on to the next chapter of work and hopefully it'll also be remote. i learned alot though, i taught my teammates a lot too. working on apps and trying to finish them this month. it was a great job though, Alhamdulillah, now i'll be able to go to pilates during the weekdays ... my personal trainer said hes going to look out for me during the week now lol

was i really being challenged at work? tbh eventually i was not, eventually it was boring

-->

# im okay dont worry about me

<!--
after my brother is done with his program early next year, the plan is that we take a trip to either hawaii or paris spring 2024, im looking forward to that ... paris for the pictures (my manolos would go with me lol) and hawaii for the beaches ... it's a toss up which vacation plan is better. i was watching a show on netflix about this realtor family that sells property in paris, interesting world, its in french though

a little busy todayy

reading some papers this morning, same thing today, more papers

theres a hiring freeze at my former manager's company which is also in nj and does bioinformatics, what a crazy world

cool, a possible first-round interview with NYU for a bioinfo position -- i hope its remote

maybe i can finish all of my apps this week

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/a-coder-considers-the-waning-days-of-the-craft  hmmmm interesting, kind of whiny actually, chatgpt is a good tool for many things,
makes programming accessible for the disadvantaged too and that wasn't included in the article, ChatGPT is incorrect at times and that wasn't mentioned either, it still needs a human element after it presents a solution

the personal statement/writing prompt for BME is a lot of work to write helpppppp meeee i dunno what to write ... what engineering anecdotes do I have like I dunno

i watched a turkish romcom yesterday, it was very sweet lol, probably in my top 30 movies

PT, sushi, some apps, hanging out with my dad this morning lol

maybe pilates today or tomorrow, working out on my spin bike & working on my apps ... i was at pilates earlier and i realized i should just enjoy whatever is happening in my life for what it is and im so happy i dont have to work for some time, i wonder how my former coworkers are going on, i was the only person who wrote code in python, two other wrote some code in unix, another used R, oh well, they gave me my severance without any problems, i dont want to say anything bad about my former company esp since theres a chance id end up workign with them again in the near future ... if theyre still in business that is

its not so much about what i have to write in the personal statements and etc. its that i must figure out generally what i want to do for the next few years, its a lot to think about

what is openai going to do now ... why do some companies make bad and poor decisions

["AI-focused YC founders"](https://twitter.com/ycombinator/status/1727021237271245155) wow interesting

im learning a lot from riding my bike every morning lol, its really fun, its very futuristic, the classes and locations are so interesting

happy early thanksgiving!! <3 busy day!!

wow interesting https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1727409374417797502

😂 https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1727751504696578510

theres a lot of weird people on the road at 4:30 am

just busy with stuff

just came back from seeing hasan minhaj on tour in nj, he's really funny, he made some good jokes about crypto/bitcoin haha

trying to finish an app today, hopefully i can do it!! 1,054 words and it needs to be under 1,000 words ahhh slowly but surely this is getting done today

ill def finish it tomorrow!! finishing uppp todayyy!! done!! time for some sushi and then i can finish up my apps at other schools, so much to do!!
-->

PT was so tough todayyyy, near the beach today

the spin bike instructor said this morning that when they were in grad school they would record their notes (i.e. voice notes) and listen to them while biking to class, thats so interesting

https://twitter.com/mediterraneanae/status/1730934566750224676 woww cool

i always drink coffee, but i like tea sometimes, i like earl grey black tea with milk, its like the best

i have to get some groceries for my mom this morning before lunch time, im so sore from my spin bike maybe ill take a break today

i got new SNEAKS today, my old salomon ones are a decade old but they're still good, my patagonia ones are too rigid

i have to finish up my last phd app, its due this friday 🥹

have you tried this panera caffeinated lemonade, how reckless is that, why does lemonade have caffeine, they should have added the words "tea" somehow if it has caffeine and people would know it has caffeine, i wouldnt try it bc of the sugar, i avoid sugar as much as i can unless, sparingly i consume sugar, i dont add sugar to my coffee/tea

im really busy, i have my umd cs phd app to finish up this week, done with my umd cs app, done with all of my apps, finally some free time.

i went outside to take out the trash and it's so cold outside

**The Process** or as I understand it:
0. find a problem worth spending time on solving
1. figure out the ml model(s) you are interested in that best solves the problem
2. OR choose (a) ml model(s) first and then apply it to a new problem worth spending time on
3. choose a programming language that is the best at solving the problem, with precision and speed, with that model
4. just do it
5. document everything, always
